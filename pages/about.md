Hey! I'm Alejandro Escalante, a 20 year old arts and animations mayor.

I like movies, computers and a little extra space

I'm a strong beveler that information as well as education shouldn't be secrets or out of reach of the general public and this is why I made this website, to publish all my academic notes, documents, articles, presentations (with and without narration) and even some homeworks as well as some personal written articles and tutorials I decide to do out of interest and passion for a given topic.

I'm currently developing '[setupesc](https://github.com/alex-esc/setupesc)' , a program to facilitate everyday use of Widows computers via macros, I'm also the author of a project called '[digital-rights](https://github.com/alex-esc/digitalrights)', This project looks to promote equal rights online and offline, It also promotes human rights and ethics applyed to modern technology.


Favorite movie: 2001 A Space Odyssey
