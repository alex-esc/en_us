Hey! I'm Alejandro Escalante, a 19 year old arts and animations mayor.

I like movies, computers and a little extra space

I'm a strong beveler that information as well as education shouldn't be secrets or out of reach of the general public and this is why I made this website, to publish all my academic notes, documents, articles, presentations (with and without narration) and even some homeworks as well as some personal written articles and tutorials I decide to do out of interest and passion for a given topic.

Favorite movie: 2001 A Space Odyssey
