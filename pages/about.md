Hello, I'm Alex Esclanate, a Mexican 21 year old psychology mayor, who formerly studied digital arts for 2 years.

I like movies and computers.

I'm a strong believer that information as well as education shouldn't be secrets or out of reach of the general public and this is why I made this website, to publish all my academic notes, documents, articles, presentations (with and without narration) and even some homework as well as some personal written articles and tutorials I decide to do out of interest and passion for a given topic.

I'm currently developing '[setupesc](https://github.com/alex-esc/setupesc)' , a program to facilitate everyday use of Widows computers via macros, I'm also the author of a project called '[digital-rights](https://github.com/alex-esc/digitalrights)', This project looks to promote equal rights online and offline, It also promotes human rights and ethics applied to modern technology.

In my free time I write on my blog, play the piano, hang out online and with friends.

If you're looking for a collaborator or are interested in one of my protects don't think twice and [get in touch](https://alex-esc.github.io/en_us/contact).
